## Deployment

The site was created in gitpod, and pushed to github to make it publicly accessible using the following commands in the terminal:

  * git add .
  * git commit -m "Description of updates since last commit"
  * git push

  Then, in Github, select the Repository > Settings > Pages. Then, under "Build and deployment" Select the required branch to publish from the dropdown menu, and Save.
  Once the updates have been pushed from Gitpod, they will show on the deployed page, usually after a minute or two.
